A memory that describes:
– the parallelization strategy,
– the changes made to the code,
– performance measurements: the acceleration (speed
up) and efficiency obtained with respect to the original using different numbers of resources,
– the performance analysis performed,
– the problem(s) found, their importance and possible
solutions,
– In addition, the report will indicate in detail how the
program should be compiled and executed.
